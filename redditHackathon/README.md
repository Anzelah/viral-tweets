REDDIT MAD LIBS
A bot creates random incomplete sentences/stories, and users fill in the blanks. Havent decided yet which to go for between the two

How It Works:
AI posts a short mad libs story with missing words. e.g. I went to the ___ and saw a ___ eating a ___
Users submit their funniest word suggestions.
Compile the funniest responses(most upvoted) into a final mad libs story.
Post the completed story as a comment or a new post.
